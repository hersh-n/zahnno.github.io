General Notes

Preferred cards are assigned as follows:
-	The last card used during checkout will be set to preferred
-	If the user has not checkout out yet but has existing cards, the preferred card will be the card most recently added

Account Management
- Saved Payments created for account management will use AuthroizeNetCim. The first card that is created will create a Customer Profile and a Payment Profile. All cards created after this will use the same Customer Profile and will have a new Payment Profile created.
